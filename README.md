Yet another Job-hunting desktop software, written in Rust. Works out of the box, no configuration required. You have full control of your data, with no concerns about security. 

Stop searching for a job when your union or government tells you to constantly, let JobHunt do it for you. Automatically! 
Be free to do whatever you want, while the AI-software finds and applies for the jobs all on its own.
No matter what you do and what you want, it can find the job by filter or by your custom liking.

Find a mentor or someone who are like you and copy they filters, so you can find the job you want more easy!
It has never been this simple to get things done in time and on point. You don't even have to do anything to begin, simply give the software your CV and a cover letter.
And watch the magic happen.
